I've made some small changes to add features I wanted to see. I probably won't do much more.
The license says I need to provide a way for you to contact me. You can do that [here.](https://elijahcirioli.com/contact/) 

    - Added a force-directed layout algorithm for graphs that uses a simple physics simulation.
    - Fixed a small bug in Layout.shiftOntoScreen() which was causing unwanted scrollbars.
    - Added color options for vertices.
    - Changed default save file directory.
    - Changed file open screen to remove horizontal scrollbar.
    - Added a tool to remove unnecessary states created as a result of converting from regular expressions.
    - Added a tool to highlight cycles in an automaton.
    - Added a tool that will tell you if a graph is strongly or weakly connected.
